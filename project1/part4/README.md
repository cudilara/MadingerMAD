# Project reflection

- What went well?
I really enjoyed this project: making the app was fun and a great learning experience. All intended features made it to the app and it looks like I imagined it at the beginning. After the project, I am definitely more comfortable with Xcode and Swift and look forward to do more next semester.
- What didn't go so well?
Embedding Youtube videos turned out to be not the best solution, as the sound stopped working on the device after an allocated amount of playing the videos. This comes from Lord of the Rings production. If I knew that, I would probably put something else instead of the official videos, for example, our favourite parts of audiobooks.
Also my code is messy. I ran out of time to refactor the code and just made it work, without making it scalable. Another aspect that I totally missed is to step back and look at the app. During the review in class, someone suggested to place the buttons differently, so that their text is displayed fully. That would take no time at all, but I was so concentrated on getting the prototype to the app, that I did not even consider to change anything.
- What would you do differently next time?
I would definitely keep in mind the points above. Will try to make time to refactor the code, step back and look at the app, and not use corporate videos.
