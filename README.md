App Dev class assignments.
- Lab1
<br> Create an app that presents the user with at least two buttons that change both an image and some text when tapped. Your app should be adaptive for different size classes(this includes portrait and landscape orientations and different device sizes). Don't forget to include app icons and a launch screen as well.
- Lab2
<br> Create an app that uses a segmented control, switch, and slider to change an image and the contents of a label including the text, text size, capitalization, and either font or text color. Your app should be adaptive for all iPhones size classes. Don't forget your app icons and launch screen.
<br> Problems: ran out of time to adjust the screen for large iPads.
- Lab3
<br> Create an app that includes multiple textfields, does a calcluation, and shows an alert or action sheet for some condition. The keyboard should be dismissed when the user taps the Done/Return key or touches the background view(hint: chapter 4 of the book) from all textfields. Your app should work for all iPhone size classes and orientation. Don't forget your app icons and launch screen.
- Lab4
<br> Create an app with multiple view controllers that share multiple pieces of data. You should use a model class for your data. Your data should be persistent between app launches. Your app should work for all iPhone size classes and orientation. Don't forget your app icons and launch screen.
- Lab5
<br> Create an Android app that uses at least 6 different UI controls and a toast. Have the widget selections change some outcome in your app such as a calculation, text, an image, etc. Your app should use a launcher icon that is not the default.
- Lab6
<br> Create an Android app with two activities, an explicit intent, and an implicit intent. Both layouts should look good in portrait and landscape orientations on phone devices. Your app should use a launcher icon that is not the default.
